# TODO

## Features to Add

- [ ] Add NTP on startup to get UTC time available for measurements
  - Nice to have: Check for epoch year 2035 issue

- [ ] Add code to smooth sensor readings
  - Note: This will probably be done on the server side

- [ ] Display startup and error messages as the program loads (after LCD is initialized)
